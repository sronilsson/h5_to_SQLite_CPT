Converts [Wavesurfer](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/Wavesurfer) hdf5 files containing photometry traces and TTLs into SQLite database aligned with touchscreen behavioral data generated by the python [rCPT task](https://github.com/sronilsson/rCPT). 

1. Place the Wavesurfer generated .h5 output file in folder and define the .h5 filename on line 19.

2. In h5tosql.py, define the behavioural log generated by the rCPT task on line 15. 

3. Run h5tosql.py

4. Plot the behavior aligned with the photometry data by running trial_curves.py
